# Goal

The main task is to check whether certain element exist in a set. That's to say, the goal here is to find whether an element is already existed in a set with efficiency. Imagine that you might want to check if the account is already taken or notwhen a user is creating an account.

In this repositroy, I implementation five data structures, including three basic data structures, list, sorted array and hash table, and two advanced data structues, bloom filters and Cuckoo filter. The unit test for the implementation is also included.


## Three basic data structures
First, we simply created a list and used linear search to find the element. Second, we store all the information in a sorted array and look for the element with binary search. In the third approach, we put all the information in a hash table and find the element through hashing.

## Bloom filter
Bloom filter is a memoery-efficiently data structure that can rapidly tell you whether a element is present in a dataset. However, the data structure can only tell us that the element either definitely is not in the set or *maybe* in the dataset. 
Each empty cell in the table represent a bit with the number as index. To add an element ot the bloom filter, we hash it a few times and set the bit in the bit vector at the index of those hashes to 1. The number of the hash function is recommended to be 
$$k = m/n*log(2)$$ , where $m$ is the length of bits vector, and $n$ is the number of elements.

To test for existence of an element, you simply hash the element with the same hash function, then see if those values are set in the bit vector. If all bits are set, then the element probably already exists. However, the tricky part of this data structue is that you can conclude that the element *might* exists, becuase another element or some combination of other element could have set the same bits.

Here are some features 
* It never generate false negative result, i.e., telling you that a element doesn't exist while it exists.
* Adding the element never fail. The false positive rate increase as elements are added until all bits are set to 1.
* Deletion is not possible.

## Cuckoo filter

Cuckoo filter is a spce-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to check whether a element is a memebr of a set, and it can delete existing element, which is not supported by bloom filter. Flase positive match are possible but false negative are not. As a result, for applicatin that store many items and target low false positive rate, cuckoo filter can achieve lower space overhead than space-optimzized bloom filter.

Cuckoo filter is a minimized hash table that uses cuckoo hashing to resolve collision. It's minized its space complexity by only keeping a f-bit fingerprint of the value to be store in a set rather than uses a bit to store data like bloom filter. It has an array of bucket. THe number of fingerprint a bucket can hold is referred to as $b$, and each bucket can have same amount of entries.  

Here is the 5 buckets cuckoo filter with 4 entries
| Bucket | 1st entry | 2nd entry | 3rd entry | 4rd entry |
| :-----: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 0 |  |  |  |  |
| 1 |  |  |  |  | 
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  | 
| 4 |  |  |  |  |

Besides, the collision of the Cuckoo filter is resolved by the Cuckoo hashing. First, we hash an entry with one hash function, and inserting a smalle f-bit fingerprint of the entry into an open position of the buckets. When the bucket is full, the filter recursively kicks existing entries to their alternate bucket with another hashing function until space is found.

## Time and space computational complexity comparison.

The time and space computational complexity of linear search, binary search, bloom filter and Cuckoo filter.

|  | Time complexity | Space computational complexity | Note | 
| :-----: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Linear search | $O(n)$ | $O(1)$ | n is the number of element |
| Binary search | $O(logn)$ | $O(1)$-Iterative<br/>$O(logn)$-Recursive |  | 
| Hashing | $O(n)$ | $O(n)$ | n is the number of element |
| Bloom filter | $O(k)$ | $1.44log( 1/fpp )$ | n: estimated number of element. <br/> m: bit array of m bits <br/> k: number of hash functions. <br/>fpp = false positive probability | 
| Cuckoo filter | $O(1)$ | $1.05[ (log(1/fpp)+2) / load ]$ | load : the percentage of the filter itâ€™s currently using. |
